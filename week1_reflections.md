# CIST4B1 Week 1 Reflection

## Data Structures Slide Notes

Definition: Data Structures are varied ways in which computer scientists interface with information (organizes data in an efficient way within computers)
- Efficient organization, storage, and access
- Store and retrieve data in an organized way
- Type of structure depends on nature of data and necessary operations
- Data manipulation

Data is the key to understanding a product and market
- Companies analyze what users are interested in or interact with
- Data helps companies understand users
- Positive/Negative implementation exists (ie: medical positive vs mass government survailence negative)

Types of Data Structures
- Record
- Array
- Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Hash table
- Max-Heap
- Graph

Why are Data Structures Important?
- Efficiency: Tasks can be done much faster with certain data structures
- Versatility: Different problems require different ways to store data
- Problem Solving: Can simplify approaches to complex problems

Definition: An algorithm is a specified set of instructions to be followed to solve a problem
- Many algorithms have required resources (ie: time, space, cost)
- Desgined to solve a problem in a reasonable time and with reasonable consumption of resources
- Achieving higher efficiency (less time/space) generally improves an algorithm
- Simplicity often preferred in programming

Why Study Algorithms?
- Precision: Clear path to solution with consistently accurate results
- Efficiency: How much time or how many resources an algorithm uses
- Universality: Allowing implementation in multiple languages
- Problem Solving: Allows for completion of complex problems.

## Short Reflection on What I've learned

This week I've learned the basics of data structures and what they entail. This includes a basic understanding of the various types of data structures that exist to use, and an understanding of why data structures are important in programmming. Additionally, I've learned about what an algorithm is and why they are important to use logic to execute a series of steps to solve a problem. We also went over what makes some algorithms "better" than others, which is based on factors like precision, efficiency, and universality. Ultimately, when implementing data structures and aglorithms simplicity, speed, and space consumption are the most important factors to keep in mind.
